    <div class="description">
    <p id="three">A really versatile grape, Pinot Noir is our favourite wine for
      any chicken or poultry based dish. Most Pinot Noirs are best consumed while
      young and fresh, but you can get some really great aged ones, too.

      <h3>Eyes, nose, mouth</h3>
        <p>Pinot Noirs have quite a clear, opaque colour for a red wine, and have
          a light red or garnet tinge. On the nose, you can expect to smell hints
          of red fruits such as strawberry, raspberry and cherry, while it also
          tastes very fruity and light, and low in acidity. You may notice a few
          vegetal notes, like mushroom.

      <h3>You might also like to try Pinot Noir with</h3>
        <p>As we've pointed out, Pinot Noir is a really diverse grape. we would
          also recommend it with cold meats, pates and terrines, as well as
          mushroom risottos, cassoulets and rare steak. How about cheeses? Well,
          it really complements Brie and mild blue cheeses such as Gorgonzola and
          Stilton.
