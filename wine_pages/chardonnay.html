    <h2>Chardonnay!</h2>
    <p id="four">Wines made from the Chardonnay grape produce very different wines
      depending on where they're grown - in cool regions like Chablis, France,
      Chardonnays are citrusy and fresh, but when grown in Australia, they produce
      wines with tropical notes. We think that it's a great pairing for veggie dishes!
    </p>
      <h3>Eyes, nose, mouth</h3>
        <p>Like we've mentioned, Chardonnay is a versatile wine, and depending
          on where it's grown has very different qualities. You can expect to see
          a golden amber colour, in your glass. Smells and tastes include green
          fruits, like apple and pear, citrus (lime, lemon, grapefruit)
          and vegetable notes (cucumber), as well as tropical fruit notes like
          peach, banana, pineapple, and maybe even a hint of mango or fig.
        </p>
      <h3>You might also like to try Chardonnay with</h3>
        <p>It's great with vegetarian options, but this grape really compliments
          fish and chicken dishes, too, going well with tuna, salmon, prawns and
          and guineafowl. It also tastes great with creamy dishes, like pasta bakes
          and soups. Chardonnay pairs with Brie and Camembert cheeses and with
          custard based desserts.
